Test Plan:

Test mymalloc and myfree with various test cases (valid and invalid use cases).

Testing:
    -Allocating entire heap with mymalloc
    -Allocating multiple chunks of memory and ensuring each mymalloc call returns a valid pointer
    -Ensuring alignment is correctly taking place when allocating chunk sizes that are non-multiples of 8
    -Denying requests of allocating invalid sizes of memory (zero or negative size, excessive memory requests)
    -Coalescing by merging free adjacent chunks to allocate larger chunk sizes
    -myfree sends error message and terminates program for invalid use cases 
    (double free, freeing null pointer, freeing invalid pointer, freeing pointer that is not at the beginning of a chunk)
